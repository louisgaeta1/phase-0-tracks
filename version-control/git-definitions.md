# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?  
Version control refers to creating "save points" in your code whenever you make changes. It is useful because it keeps a log of changes and allows you to roll back to a previous build if any mistakes are discovered. 
* What is a branch and why would you use one?  
A branch is a separate copy of code base intended to be used to work on a specific feature. You would use one so that multiple people can work on different parts of the same code base at the same time.
* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?  
A commit is a saved rollback point in a particular branch. A good commit message has a clear description of the change without being too wordy.
* What is a merge conflict?  
A merge conflict is when two different branches have commits with conflicting changes.
