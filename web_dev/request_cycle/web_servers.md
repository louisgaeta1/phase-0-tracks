In your own words, what is a VPS (virtual private server)? What, according to your research, are the advantages of using a VPS?

A VPS is a virtual web server. Virtual refers to not existing as a single physical machine but rather as shared virtual space on a machine dedicated to hosting virtual systems. VPS's are more cost efficient and are easier to set up. A VPS is more versatile and can be hosted virtually anywhere and they can be easily removed, recreated and duplicated as needed.

Optional bonus question: Why is it considered a bad idea to run programs as the root user on a Linux system?

Running software as root gives it admin level permissions to alter and access files across the system. By doing this you open yourself up to more vulnerabilities and create unecessary danger of deleting or changing something that you shouldn't. Operations that require root access should only be done as a case by case basis to avoid any accidental damage and so that you can contain any issues caused to one particular operation.
