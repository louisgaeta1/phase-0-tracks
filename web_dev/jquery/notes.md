- Look for a jquery cheat sheet and read it over.
- Look for instructions on how to set up jquery.
- Look for and complete a short jquery tutorial.
- Look for the official jquery documentation

Looking up how to set up jquery first and then doing a tutorial was very effective for me. I also found it effective to review cheat sheets and documentation as I was putting together my project.
