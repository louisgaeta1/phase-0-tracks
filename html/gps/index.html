<!--What is the purpose of HTML5 semantic tags? Which ones do you see as most useful?

Semantic tags help to break up html content in logical ways. Currently I see nav and section as the most useful since they seem to have the clearest meaning to them. 

What is the order the browser uses to display elements on a page?

The browser displays elements in the body from top to bottom. 

What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date?

I learned that sublime has some customization options to it that makes it ideal for writing code. I definitely see myself creating snippets in my career to help save some time writing things out that I need to every time.

What concept in this challenge was most difficult for you? How can you improve 
your understanding of this concept?

Learning the many uses of the semantic tags was the most confusing to me. I think I'll improve my understanding of the concept with the more HTML I'm ultimately exposed to. Also looking up best practices when it comes to organizing semantic tags will be helpful as well.
